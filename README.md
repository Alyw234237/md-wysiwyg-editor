# Markdown WYSIWYG Editor

"Markdown WYSIWYG Editor" (placeholder name) is a simple web rich-text/WYSIWYG markdown editor. It is a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) made with [TinyMCE 5](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce), various markdownâ€“HTML conversion engines ([markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), [Turndown](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown), and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)), and the new [Native File System](https://web.dev/native-file-system/) (NFS) API (thanks to Google's demo [Text Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-editor) code). Currently in a developmental stageâ€”[use cautiously!](#Notes)

## Features

* Rich-text/WYSIWYG markdown (or HTML) editor.
* File handling: open, save, save as, and open with/file association of markdown, HTML, and text files via the new Native File System API. Your web browser must support this API and it must be enabled.
* Bidirectional live editing between rich-text and markdown views (as well as an HTML view).
* Rich-text is restricted essentially to the formatting options of markdown and a small amount more. The rich-text features that are supported include headings, bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, block quotes, code, tables, images, and horizontal lines. Everything elseâ€”e.g. font size, colors, alignment, positioning, etc.â€”is automatically filtered as soon as it enters the editor.
* Automatic conversion of typed markdown syntax into rich-text formatting in rich-text editing mode. For example, typing `# Header title` will make an H1 header and typing `This text is bold.` will give bolded text. In addition to markdown syntax, certain strings will convert to special characters (e.g., `--` to en dash and `---` to em dash). See [pattern-conversions.md](docs/pattern-conversions.md) for a list of conversions.
* Keyboard shortcuts for editing, formatting, etc. (except where prevented by browserâ€”e.g., Ctrl+N for new file in non-app mode). See [keyboard-shortcuts.md](docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a list.
* Works offline when installed as a PWA.
* Works on mobile and addable to homescreen (simulates an app).
* Light and dark modes.
* Option to switch between HTML-to-markdown conversion engines ([Turndown](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown) and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)). The Turndown engine generally seems to produce better output and is set to default. Some plugins for additional markdown syntax (e.g., tables) are included with the engines.
* Option to switch between markdown-to-HTML conversion engines ([markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)). Some plugins for additional markdown syntax (e.g., tables) are included with the engines.
* Optional customization of rich-text appearance via CSS in preferences. You can use this feature to make your markdown files look/render just like they would on your own website.

## Notes

The editor is still under development and has [many bugs](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md) that need to be fixed.

Due to the bidirectional conversion between rich text/HTML and markdown, the editor may alter markdown filesâ€”sometimes in undesirable ways. A number of examples are illustrative. Escapes (`\`) may be added to certain markdown syntax characters that aren't part of the markdown (e.g., `~`, `|`). Headerless markdown tables will be escaped and thereby broken with Showdown as the HTML-to-markdown engine. YAML and TOML front matter is automatically put inside of a markdown code block (<code>```</code>) to prevent it from being parsed by the HTML-to-markdown engines. Changes to markdown files will vary depending on whether Turndown or Showdown is selected as the HTML-to-markdown conversion engine. For example, Showdown doesn't handle headerless tables, whereas Turndown does thanks to a plugin. For markdown-to-HTML conversion, only markdown-it handles headerless tables.

Rich-text HTML editing with the editor is solid. But, as described, the markdown functionality may have issues here and there. Hence, you've been warnedâ€”use the markdown featuresâ€”specifically bidirectional HTMLâ€“markdown conversion via markdown pane and open/save files as markdownâ€”at your own risk!

### Future

* Lots of [bug fixes](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md) and minor features.
* Add more markdownâ€“HTML conversion engine options (e.g., [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked))?
* Replace the markdown pane editor with a code editor library (for, e.g., markdown syntax highlighting)?
* Tabs for multiple files at once?
* Left pane for folder/workspace and tab for file table of contents?
* Other things...
