# Markdown WYSIWYG Editor

"Markdown WYSIWYG Editor" (placeholder name) is a simple web rich-text/WYSIWYG markdown editor. It is a [progressive web app](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) made with [TinyMCE 5](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce) and [EasyMDE](https://easymde.tk/), various markdownâ€“HTML conversion engines ([markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), [Turndown](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown), and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)), and the new [Native File System](https://web.dev/native-file-system/) (NFS) API (credit to Google's demo [Text Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-editor) code). Currently in a developmental stageâ€”[use cautiously!](#Notes)

## Features

* Rich-text/WYSIWYG markdown editor. WYSIWYG, markdown, and split-screen editing modes. Bidrectional live updating between views.
* Open and save files as markdown, HTML, or plain text. File association / "open with" support for these file formats. This functionality is implemented via the new Native File System API. The web browser must support this API and it must be enabled.
* Rich-text editing mode is restricted essentially to the formatting options of markdown and a small amount more. The rich-text features that are supported include headings, bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, block quotes, code, tables, images, and horizontal lines. Everything elseâ€”e.g. font size, colors, alignment, positioning, etc.â€”is automatically filtered and discarded as soon as it enters the editor.
* Automatic conversion of typed markdown syntax into rich-text formatting in rich-text editing mode. For example, typing `# Header title` will make an H1 header and typing `This text is bold` will give bolded text. In addition to markdown syntax, certain strings will convert to special characters (namely `--` to en dash and `---` to em dash). See [pattern-conversions.md](docs/pattern-conversions.md) for a list of conversions.
* Keyboard shortcuts for editing, formatting, and so forth. (except where prevented by browserâ€”e.g., Ctrl+N for new file in non-app mode). See [keyboard-shortcuts.md](docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a list.
* Works offline when installed as a PWA.
* Works on mobile and installable as an app (via add to homescreen).
* Light and dark modes.
* Option to switch between HTML-to-markdown conversion engines ([Turndown](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown) and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)). The Turndown engine generally seems to produce better output and is set to default. Some plugins for additional markdown syntax (e.g., headerless tables) are included with the engines.
* Option to switch between markdown-to-HTML conversion engines ([markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)). Some plugins for additional markdown syntax (e.g., headerless tables) are included with the engines.
* Optional customization of rich-text appearance via CSS in preferences. You can use this feature to make your markdown files look/render just like they would on your own website.

## Notes

The editor is still under development and has [many bugs](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md) that need to be fixed.

Due to the bidirectional conversion between rich text/HTML and markdown, the editor may alter markdown filesâ€”sometimes in undesirable ways. A number of examples are illustrative. Escapes (`\`) may be added to certain markdown syntax characters that aren't part of the markdown (e.g., `~`, `|`). Headerless markdown tables will be escaped and thereby broken with Showdown as the HTML-to-markdown engine. YAML and TOML front matter is automatically put inside of markdown code blocks (<code>```</code>) to prevent it from being parsed by the HTML-to-markdown conversion engines. Changes to markdown files will vary depending on whether Turndown or Showdown is selected as the HTML-to-markdown conversion engine. For example, Showdown doesn't handle headerless tables, whereas Turndown does thanks to a plugin. For markdown-to-HTML conversion, only markdown-it handles headerless tables. Headerless tables must at least have a `| --- | --- | ... |` row.

Rich-text HTML editing with the editor is solid. But, as described, the markdown functionality may have issues here and there. Hence, you've been warnedâ€”use the markdown features at your own risk! Specifically, HTMLâ€“markdown interconversion via usage of the markdown editing mode as well as opening/saving files as markdown.

The editor is slow with larger files in split-screen mode when markdown syntax highlighting/styling is on.

The editor has only been tested on Google Chrome at this time.

### Future

* Lots of [bug fixes](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md) and minor features.
* Incremental updating for markdownâ€“HTML conversion to make things faster?
* Tabs for multiple files at once?
* Left pane with tabs for folder/workspace and document table of contents?
* Other things...

None of these editors currently offer a 100% rich-text/WYSIWYG markdown-editing experience like "Markdown WYSIWYG Editor" does (with the notable exception of UNOTES, a [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) extension). In addition, none of the web editors are progressive web apps or have Native File System integration at this time.
