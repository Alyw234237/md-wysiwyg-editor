# Text Editor

"Text Editor" (placeholder name) is a simple online constrained-rich-text and markdown editor. It is a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) made with [TinyMCE 5](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce), [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown), [Turndown](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown), and the new [Native File System](https://web.dev/native-file-system/) (NFS) API (via Google's demo [Text Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-editor) code). Currently in a developmental stageâ€”[use cautiously!](#Notes)

### Requirements

Make sure that your web browser is up to date and you have Native File System enabled (e.g., in Google Chrome flagsâ€”not enabled by default at this time):

* [chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api](chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api)
* [chrome://flags/#file-handling-api](chrome://flags/#file-handling-api)

## Features

* Rich-text/WYSIWIG markdown editor.
* File handling: open, save, save as, and open with/file association of markdown, HTML, and text files via Native File System API.
* Bidirectional live editing between rich-text and markdown views (as well as an HTML view).
* Rich-text is constrained essentially to the formatting options of markdown and a small amount more. The rich-text features that are supported include headings, bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, block quotes, code, tables, images, and horizontal lines. Everything elseâ€”e.g. font size, colors, alignment, positioning, etc.â€”is automatically sanitized and filtered as soon as it enters the editor.
* Automatic conversion of typed markdown syntax into rich-text formatting in rich-text editing mode. For example, typing `# Header title` will make an H1 header and typing `This text is bold.` will give bolded text. In addition to markdown syntax, certain strings will convert to special characters (e.g., `--` to en dash and `---` to em dash). See [pattern-conversions.md](docs/pattern-conversions.md) for a list of conversions.
* Keyboard shortcuts for editing, formatting, etc. (except where prevented by browserâ€”e.g., Ctrl+N for new file in non-app mode). See [keyboard-shortcuts.md](docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a list.
* Works offline when installed as a PWA. Mobile-friendly. Light and dark modes.
* Option to switch between HTML-to-markdown conversion engines (Turndown and Showdown) in preferences. The Turndown engine is better for this conversion and is set to default. Markdown-to-HTML conversion is always handled by Showdown.
* Optional customization of rich-text appearance via CSS in preferences.

## Notes

The editor is still under development and has [many bugs](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md).

Due to the bidirectional conversion between rich text/HTML and markdown, the editor may alter markdown filesâ€”sometimes in undesirable ways. A number of examples are illustrative. Escapes (`\`) may be added to certain markdown syntax characters that aren't part of the markdown (e.g., `~`, `|`). Headerless markdown tables will be escaped and thereby broken with Showdown as the HTML-to-markdown engine. YAML and TOML front matter is automatically put inside of a markdown code block (<code>```</code>) to prevent it from being parsed by the HTML-to-markdown engines. Changes to markdown files will vary depending on whether Turndown or Showdown is selected as the HTML-to-markdown conversion engine. For example, Showdown doesn't handle headerless tables, whereas Turndown does via a plugin although it adds an empty header row to the tables and doesn't always work.

Rich-text editing is dependable but as described the markdown functionality has issues here and there. Hence, you've been warnedâ€”use the markdown features (bidirectional HTMLâ€“markdown conversion via markdown pane and open/save files as markdown) at your own risk!

### Future

* Lots of [bug fixes](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md) and minor features.
* Tabs for multiple documents at once?
* Pane for files and table of contents?
* Other things...
