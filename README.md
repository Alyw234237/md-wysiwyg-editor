# Text Editor

Text Editor is a simple online constrained-rich-text and markdown editor. It is a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) made with [TinyMCE 5](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce), [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) (via a modified [TinyMCE labs plugin](https://www.tiny.cloud/labs/markdown/)), and the emerging [Native File System](https://web.dev/native-file-system/) (NFS) API (via Google's demo [Text Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-editor) code).

## Launch

Visit this link to launch the application:

<ul><li><a href="https://alyw234237.github.io/text-editor/">https://alyw234237.github.io/text-editor/</a></li></ul>

Make sure that your web browser is up to date and you have Native File System enabled (e.g., in Google Chrome flagsâ€”not enabled by default at this time):

<ul><li><a href="chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api">chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api</a></li><li><a href="chrome://flags/#file-handling-api">chrome://flags/#file-handling-api</a></li></ul>

## Features

<ul><li>Open and save files as markdown (MD), constrained rich-text (HTML), and plain text (TXT).</li><li>Bidirectional live editing between rich-text and markdown views. Also an HTML code view and editor.</li><li>Rich-text is constrained essentially to the formatting options of markdown and a small amount more. The rich-text features that are supported include headings, bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, block quotes, code, tables, images, and horizontal lines. Everything elseâ€”e.g. font size, colors, alignment, positioning, etc.â€”is automatically sanitized and filtered as soon as it enters the editor.</li><li>Automatic conversion of typed markdown syntax into rich text in rich-text editing mode. For example, typing <code># Header title</code> will make an H1 header and typing <code>**This text is bold.**</code> will give bolded text. These conversions for links, images, task lists, and tables are not supported. In addition to markdown syntax, certain strings will convert to special characters (e.g., <code>--</code> to en dash and <code>---</code> to em dash). See <a href="docs/pattern-conversions.md">pattern-conversions.md</a> for a list of conversions.</li><li>Keyboard shortcuts for editing, formatting, etc. (except where prevented by browserâ€”e.g., Ctrl+N for new file in non-app mode). See <a href="docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md">keyboard-shortcuts.md</a> for a list.</li><li>Works offline when installed as a PWA.</li><li>Mobile-friendly.</li><li>Dark mode.</li><li>Optional customization of rich-text appearance via CSS in preferences.</li></ul>

## Notes

Due to the bidirectional conversion between rich text/HTML and markdown, the editor may alter your markdown files. For instance, certain characters may be escaped. Most importantly however, currently there's a limitation that causes front matter (e.g., YAML) to be removed from markdown files.

### Future

<ul><li>"Open with" / file association support.</li><li>Lots of bug fixes.</li></ul>
