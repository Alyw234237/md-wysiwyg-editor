# Text Editor

Text Editor is a simple online constrained-rich-text and markdown editor. It is a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) made with [TinyMCE 5](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce), [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) (via a modified [TinyMCE labs plugin](https://www.tiny.cloud/labs/markdown/)), and the emerging [Native File System](https://web.dev/native-file-system/) (NFS) API (via Google's demo [Text Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-editor) code). Currently in [alphaâ€”use at own risk.](#Notes)

## Launch

Visit this link to launch the application:

* [https://alyw234237.github.io/text-editor/](https://alyw234237.github.io/text-editor/)

Make sure that your web browser is up to date and you have Native File System enabled (e.g., in Google Chrome flagsâ€”not enabled by default at this time):

* [chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api](chrome://flags/#native-file-system-api)
* [chrome://flags/#file-handling-api](chrome://flags/#file-handling-api)

## Features

* Open and save files as markdown (MD), constrained rich-text (HTML), and plain text (TXT).
* Bidirectional live editing between rich-text and markdown views. Also an HTML code view and editor.
* Rich-text is constrained essentially to the formatting options of markdown and a small amount more. The rich-text features that are supported include headings, bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, block quotes, code, tables, images, and horizontal lines. Everything elseâ€”e.g. font size, colors, alignment, positioning, etc.â€”is automatically sanitized and filtered as soon as it enters the editor.
* Automatic conversion of typed markdown syntax into rich text in rich-text editing mode. For example, typing `# Header title` will make an H1 header and typing `This text is bold.` will give bolded text. These conversions for links, images, task lists, and tables are not supported. In addition to markdown syntax, certain strings will convert to special characters (e.g., `--` to en dash and `---` to em dash). See [pattern-conversions.md](docs/pattern-conversions.md) for a list of conversions.
* Keyboard shortcuts for editing, formatting, etc. (except where prevented by browserâ€”e.g., Ctrl+N for new file in non-app mode). See [keyboard-shortcuts.md](docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a list.
* Works offline when installed as a PWA.
* Mobile-friendly.
* Dark mode.
* Optional customization of rich-text appearance via CSS in preferences.

## Notes

The editor is still under development and is very buggy.

Due to the bidirectional conversion between rich text/HTML and markdown, the editor may alter your markdown files in unanticipated and/or undesirable ways. For instance, right now there's a bug that causes front matter (e.g., YAML) to be removed from markdown files. These are because of the internal Showdown conversion engine.

Use at your own risk.

### Future

* "Open with" / file association support.
* Lots of bug fixes and minor features.
* Other things...
